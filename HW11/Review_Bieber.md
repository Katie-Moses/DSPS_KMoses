Review:
The new graph adds better color contrast between the colors, which enhances overall accessiblity and readability of the data. The graph also includes grid lines, a title, updated axes labels, and includes a caption. These help convey the data more effectively, which again helps to reduce ambiguity of the plot. There was nothing overtly distracting from the old graph, and the new graph does not add anything that could lead to a distraction from the data.
