This updated plot is definitely an improvement of the original. The gridlines help with readability, and the use of colorblind friendly colors also improves readability for colorblind people. Scaling down the markersize reduces readability, and the legend is cleaner and easier to read.
In terms of Tufte's rules, the updated plot better satisfies several of them. Shrinking down the marker sizes and choosing the colorblind friendly set of colors increases the data/ink ratio. The removal of large datapoints also reduces chart junk. The gridlines also makes it easier to interpret the plot. The updated plot avoids redundant encoding by only using colors to differentiate filters and nothing else, although the original plot did this, the updated plot maintains avoiding the redundant coding, which is a plus. The plot also maintains a lie factor ~ 1. Overall this is a good improvement.

# Bad Plot From Literature:

This plot tries to show too many things in one plot. The Rayleigh scatter vs. pumping energy is already difficult to interpret due to the y axis being compressed and the datapoints being too clustered. Putting an illustration of the actual experiment in the same plot causes severe clutter. 
In terms of Tufte's rules this figure violates several of them. Overlaying the entire experiment lowers the data/ink ratio. There is a lot of chart junk due to the decorative shapes, colors, and arrows. The lie factor is inflated due to the experiment shown in the plot because it distorts the relative scaling of the plot. This also violates the avoiding reduncancy rule, as multiple kinds of information in the form of data, experiment layout, labels, etc. are all in the same gracph even though they represent different things. Overall this plot has a lot of ambiguity and distraction and unnecessary visual density.
