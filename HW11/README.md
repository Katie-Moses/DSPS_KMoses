## Group Members
In this homework I worked with TJ and Jarrod, but mostly for the first half.

## Team Work
I worked with TJ on the first few sections of the notebook, mainly making sure I read in the dataset properly and the initial model (which I did have to tweak a bit). Then the three of us bounced ideas around for other parts of the notebook. Once I got to the Convolution Neural Network, I would develop the rest on my own and then helped TJ a little with his. Jarrod and I barely worked directly together.
