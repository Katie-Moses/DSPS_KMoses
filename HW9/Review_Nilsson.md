The changes to this plot definitely improved the ambiguity of the data. The points are easier to see within each other, h. Ambiguity could still be improved by including the unit for the x-axis. I don’t think the original plot had problems with distorting the data, and neither does this plot. This plot reduces the distraction of the points from each other by sizing them down.

Considering Tufte’s rules, the data/ink ratio is improved, especially since the original plot had some points that were larger than the error bars. The effect size is ~1, there is no chart junk, and there is no redundancy in communication.

This plot also improves the accessibility of the figure by changing the color palette to a color-blind friendly one. The palette uses desaturated colors that, to me, get lost within the gray border around the points, making it a little harder to distinguish points when they’re clustered together.

While including the diagram on the plot is an inventive way to fill empty space, it does distract from the plotted data, especially since the fiber drawing being so close to the red points makes it look like it’s supposed to be a trend line (to me, at least.) The non-diagram part of the plot is a little ambiguous because there is no legend on the plot, so without a caption I don’t know what the red squares are versus the blue diamonds. I don’t think the plot distorts the data.

Considering the 5 Tufte’s rules, this definitely violates “no chart junk” just because the diagram is distracting. I guess this should be split up into small multiples if “make the diagram of the set up a different figure” counts as a small multiple. However, i would say that otherwise, the plot does respect Tufte’s rules.

The plot is also color-blind friendly. The two types of points are different shapes as well as different colors and the diagram doesn’t rely on color to give information. 

I agree that the main problem with the plot (honestly, the only problem) is that the diagram is included on the plot of the data, and it could be separated out and replaced with a legend explaining what each point is.
