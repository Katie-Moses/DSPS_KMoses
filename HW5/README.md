In this homework I worked with TJ Tomaszewski and Jarrod Bieber.

## Team Work
For Hacking PI: Jarrod and I both developed our own versions seperately, then TJ reviewed everything and spotted errors in our own versions. 

GRB: Since I was out sick, Jarrod and TJ developed everything. For the most part, I used their stuff more as reference and tried to develop the rest on my own, since the vast majority of stuff was pre-written. This way, I could gain a better understanding of the assignment and not blindly copy/pasting it.

For M-H MCMC: I developed it while both TJ and Jarrod helped me float ideas and reviewed it afterwards.
