In this homework I worked with TJ Tomaszewski and Jarrod Bieber.

## Team Work
For Hacking PI: Jarrod and I both developed our own versions seperately, then TJ reviewed everything and spotted errors in our own versions. 

GRB: 

For M-H MCMC: I developed it while both TJ and Jarrod helped me float ideas and reviewed it afterwards.
