In this homework I worked with TJ Tomaszewski and Jarrod Bieber.

## Team Work
For MWrotCurve: Jarrod did the vast majority of the work on the Dark Matter section of the homework. TJ and I both checked his notebook, but he completed it far before we actually teamed up to work on this homework. I also helped Jarrod with troubleshooting vratios and the standard deviation math since the formula ChatGPT gave was errorsome. TJ created the logspace plots, worked on the Newtonian derrivation, and bugfixed the gal() function to ensure it could pass in Milky Way / other data.
For Homework 3 Part II: I spent a good deal of time conseptualizing the problem, and the initial code of the problem. TJ helped get ideas down on the chalkboard for reference, and built out the problem that way, figuring out what we didn't know. Jarrod helped immensely with this part as well. After I had determined code flow and was able to get individual data points (outside of a for loop), TJ got the code working in a for loop with the help of ChatGPT and got everything formatted correctly with assistance from Jarrod. I was able to read and understand the code, and was able to compare our graphs to those in Correll's 2018 and explain the significance of the results. Finally, TJ also worked on some of the coordination aspects of both notebooks.
