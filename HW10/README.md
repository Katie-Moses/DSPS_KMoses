## Group Members
In this homework I mostly worked alone, but also slightly with TJ and Jarrod

## Team Work
All of the coding that was not done in class was my own. I bounced some ideas off of TJ and Jarrod near the beginning for some conceptual ideas, and for some sanity checks, but the vast majority (> 95%) of this homework was done by myself.
